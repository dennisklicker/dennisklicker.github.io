## Executive Summary

<p>I am a seasoned Community Manager with a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, specializing in Ethereum, Tezos, and other blockchain technologies. My expertise extends to decentralized finance, including smart contracts, non-fungible tokens, and liquidity provisioning. I have a strong technical background, with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server administration, complemented by experience in developing UI/UX. My professional experience includes managing and growing online communities, developing and implementing outreach strategies, and maintaining company websites.</p>

<p>For the last two and a half years I've been very deep into the Tezos ecosystem specifically. I've worked with multiple DeFi and NFT platforms (SmartLink, Tezsure/Plenty, Tezos Commons, DNS.xyz), and consider myself extremely well versed in both DeFi & NFT fundamentals, and regularly search out new protocols, dapps, and blockchains. I'm also very adept at explaining these concept to people who aren't familiar with DeFi or cryptocurrency in general. My transparency, identity, and skillset make me a trustworthy player within the communities that I participate. </p>
