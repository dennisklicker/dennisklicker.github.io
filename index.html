## Executive Summary 🧠

<p>I am a seasoned Community Manager with a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency/blockchain/web3 industry. I specialize in Ethereum, Tezos, and other smart contract powered blockchains. My expertise extends to decentralized finance and NFTs, including smart contracts (architecture, development, & deployment), tokenization/tokenomics & standardization (ERC-20/721/1155s, FA2, BRCs), and liquidity provisioning. I have a strong technical background, with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server administration, complemented by experience in developing UI/UX. My professional experience includes managing and growing online communities, developing and implementing outreach strategies, and maintaining company websites and documentation.</p>

<p>For the last two and a half years I've been very deep into the Tezos ecosystem specifically. I've worked with multiple DeFi and NFT platforms (SmartLink, Tezsure/Plenty, Tezos Commons, DNS.xyz), and consider myself extremely well versed in both DeFi & NFT fundamentals, and regularly search out new protocols, dapps, and blockchains. I'm also very adept at explaining these concept to people who aren't familiar with DeFi or cryptocurrency in general. My transparency, identity, and skillset make me a trustworthy player within the communities that I participate. For the last few months I've been engrossed in the fast growing Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem, which I have a deep understanding of and actively are participating in. </p>
